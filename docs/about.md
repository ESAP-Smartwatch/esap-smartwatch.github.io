# About {{ site.serverName }}

The ESAP Smartwatch project is an open-source initiative by the Embedded Systems @ Purdue team to create a fully functional, customizable smartwatch with health tracking capabilities.

## Project Goals

Our mission is to provide an accessible, educational platform for learning about:
- Embedded systems design and development
- PCB design and manufacturing
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication
- Mobile app development with React Native
- Health tracking algorithms and sensors
- Open-source hardware principles
